# retired-wwmoodle
Moodle modules for the assignment level bridge between WeBWorK and Moodle.

The modules in this repostory have been replaced by the modules `wwassignment` and `wwlink` which work with the modern 
versions of Moodle2.x (branch ver2.8).  There is a legacy branch (ver1.9) which will work with the last of the Moodle1.9.x releases.


Read the instructions in their README for installation procedures.
